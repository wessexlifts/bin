## Marketing Images

A batch script deployed in main image folder to rename images nicely (mainly remove the brackets and spaces from Windows default bulk renaming). Requires ImageMagick to resize the images and store them in the lq (low quality) folder. Folder structure is as follows;

```
	scripts
	|   marketing-images.bat
	|   
	+---EG
	|   +---final
	|   |   +---lq
	|   |   |       EG-1.jpg
	|   |   |       
	|   |   \---oq
	|   |           EG-1.jpg
	|   |           
	|   \---raw
	|           Unedited-EG (1).jpg
	etc.
```
